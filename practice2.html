        Kansas City Chiefs cornerback L'Jarius Sneed is having a great year at an opportune time.
        His four-year, $3.9 million contract expires at the end of the 2023 season.
        “I don't think about that,” Sneed exclusively shared. “I'm just playing ball right now.
        That will take care of itself when the time comes.”Though Sneed may not be focused on his
        contract right now, he's proving that he will deserve a lucrative deal.
        Having moved from the nickel corner to the outside with the emergence of Trent McDuffie at
        his former spot, Sneed routinely shadows the offense's best wide receiver.
